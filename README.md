# NZWalksAPI

Creating a Web API in which will holds data around the regions and walks of New Zealand. I am creating a ASP.NET Core Web API so that clients of this API are able to consume this data. This web API will be be to perform CRUD operations.

I will be creating controllers for the API and test them using Swagger and Postman.
